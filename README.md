## Background
React Arena is a demo ticket-booking interface web application. It was created for the purpose of improving my skills at using web technologies such as HTML, React, and the Next.js framework.

Through the creation of this project, I was able to learn a lot of skills related to web development, such as state management, creating responsive componenets and designs, and using optimization of rendering using React Hooks.

## Overview
This demo app is themed around the 2026 World Cup. Users can select a location to purchase tickets from, where they will be prompted with an interface where they can select seats on a seatmap. The price of seats vary depending on their location. Users can select multiple seats at once if desired.

"Purchased" tickets can also be viewed on a separate page, where there is an option to cancel them if desired.

## Installation
After cloning this repository, run the following commands in the project root folder:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server. The app can be viewed on http://localhost:3000
